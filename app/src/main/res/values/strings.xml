    A farmer and his wolf, goat, and cabbage come to the edge of
    a river they wish to cross. There is a boat at the river\'s edge
    that only the farmer can row. The farmer can take at most one other
    object besides himself on a crossing, but if the wolf is ever left with
    the goat, the wolf will eat the goat; similarly, if the goat is left with
    the cabbage. Devise a sequence of crossings of the river so that all four
    characters arrive safely on the other side.</string>
    <string name ="puzzleIntro">You are given a board in which numbered tiles can slide around.
            There is one blank space that holds no tile.  A legal move
            consists of sliding a tile into the blank space if the tile is
            adjacent to it. The goal is to move tiles around until the board
            looks like the final state below.</string>
